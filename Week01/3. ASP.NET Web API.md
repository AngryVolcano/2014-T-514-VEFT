# ASP.NET Web API

In 2012, Microsoft released the first version of the [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) framework, 
which was designed to create RESTful web services.

Currently, this is Windows only. However, Microsoft is working on the next version, with the codename "ASP.NET vNext".
This version will unify all ASP.NET tecnhologies (Web Forms, MVC, Web API) into a single codebase, which will be
cross-platform. This version is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/aspnet).

## Architecture

Similar to ASP.NET MVC, a Web API uses a Controller to specify methods which map to URLs. However, the base class is
different, i.e. we must derive our controllers from ApiController (either directly or indirectly). (Sidenote: in vNext
there will be a single base class for MVC and Web API controllers).

## JSON or XML?

In ASP.NET MVC, it is possible to create a method which returns JSON data explicitly. However, REST is **not** 
tied to any one type of formatting, and a Web Service is by no means required to return JSON data. Fortunately, 
the Web API framework takes care of this for us. Assume we've got a POCO class:

```c#
public class CourseGrade
{
    public int   CourseID { get; set; }
    public float Grade    { get; set; }
}
```

and a corresponding Web API method which returns a list of grades:

```c#
public class MyController : ApiController
{
    public List<CourseGrade> Grades()
    {
      // TODO: load the grades for the currently logged in user, and return them!
    }
}
```
As you will notice, the method is defined to return just a simple list of the CourseGrade class. There is 
nowhere any mention of either JSON nor XML. What happens behind the scenes is that the Web API framework will
examine the "Accept" HTTP header, which will contain the MIME type which the client requests. This will 
usually contain either "application/xml" or "application/json". The framework will then use a corresponding serializer,
based on this.

Note that the Web API framework has built-in support for these two formats, but we can easily add support for other
formats as well: CSV, iCal, plain text etc.
