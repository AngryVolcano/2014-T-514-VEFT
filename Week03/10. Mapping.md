# Mapping

As we've seen, the separation between entity classes and DTO/ViewModel classes does involve some code which must move data
from one (or more) object(s) to another:

TODO: example!

For small classes (with few properties), this may not be that much of an issue.
However, if one of the following applies:

a) there are many properties to map to/from,
b) the mapping needs to happen in several places,
c) the classes in question might be prone to changes, i.e. we might want to add properties to them which must be mapped

then this could be an issue. In that case, we should try to move mapping to a central place. This could involve a 
custom (hand-written) routine, perhaps as an extension method:

TODO: example!!!

This could quickly become tedious, especially when the mapping is trivial.

Some solutions have been developed which make this a bit easier, such as [AutoMapper](http://automapper.org/). Using
AutoMapper, we need to specify at startup that we wish to be able to map between certain types:

TODO:

This step is necessary for performance reasons. AutoMapper reads the information about each type and what properties
can be mapped, but this is time-consuming and would slow down our code if this would be done each time we would 
need to map between two objects. 

Then, when the need arises to map between two types, we can do so using the following code:

TODO:

Then there are those that say [we should avoid tools such as AutoMapper](http://www.uglybugger.org/software/post/friends_dont_let_friends_use_automapper). There are also
a few reasons why a DTO->Entity mapping [might be a bad idea](http://rogeralsing.com/2013/12/01/why-mapping-dtos-to-entities-using-automapper-and-entityframework-is-horrible/).
