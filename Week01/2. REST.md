# REST Services

[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REpresenational State Transfer) services were defined in a dissertation written by Roy Fielding in 2000.

The main characteristics of a REST service are:

* Resources
* Stateless
* Cacheable
* Use HTTP

## REST Maturity Model

The REST Maturity Model was defined in 2008 by [Leonard Richardson](http://www.crummy.com/).

It has 4 levels:

* Level 0: A single URL, only accessible using HTTP POST
* Level 1: Resources
* Level 2: HTTP verbs
* Level 3: Hypermedia controls

Most REST services written today are at level 2 (or perhaps 2.5).

## HATEOAS

At level 3, a REST service will only define a single URL (a Root URL), which all subresources are accessible through.
