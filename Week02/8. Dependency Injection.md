# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a loaded name and may sound complicated but as [James Shore] (http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html) said:
'"Dependency Injection" is a 25-dollar term for a 5-cent concept. [...] Dependency injection means giving an object its instance variables. Really. That's it.". 

Dependency Injection is an expression coined by [Martin Fowler] (http://martinfowler.com/). Dependency injection decouples classes by removing dependencies on specific implementations and thus allows classes to rely on abstractions instead. There are three ways to inject dependencies, via constructor injection, property injection or parameter injection. Usually a framework such as [StructureMap] (http://docs.structuremap.net/) or [Ninject] (http://www.ninject.org/) is used to deal with the instancing and providing of the implementations.
DI makes code more maintainable. When an implementation needs to be replaced, due to changes in requirements, the developer does no have to modify the core of the application but only create a new implementation of the interface and then inject that instead of the previous one which is a very helpful tool when trying to conform to the [Open/Closed Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)). Another situation is where the specific implementation of an interface is only known during runtime, DI can be used to provide appropriate implementation in those scenarios.

When using DI you are forced to use interfaces, which comes with the bonus of code being more testable. The interfaces can be used to create mocks of the implementation, thus allowing developers to test classes in isolation, but mocking will not be covered in this section.

Lets look at an example:
