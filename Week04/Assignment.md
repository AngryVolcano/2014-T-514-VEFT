# Week 4 assignment

Note: you don't have to hand in anything in this assignment.

## LINQ join

Using the example provided in week 4 (TODO), write the following queries:

* list all teachers which teach a course in semester "20143"
* list all courses taught in fall 2014 (i.e. with semester == "20143"), and include the name of the main teacher, or an empty string if the given course has no main teacher.

## Auto mapper

Add Auto Mapper to the project, and implement the GetStudentsInCourse method using mapping provided by that library.
