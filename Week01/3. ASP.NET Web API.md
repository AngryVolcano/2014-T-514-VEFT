# ASP.NET Web API

In 2012 (?), Microsoft released the first version of the ASP.NET Web API framework, which was designed 
to create RESTful web services.

Currently, this is Windows only. However, Microsoft is working on the next version, with the codename "ASP.NET vNext".
This version will unify all ASP.NET tecnhologies (Web Forms, MVC, Web API) into a single codebase, which will be
cross-platform.
