## Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development. - From first paragraph in wikipedia article [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software))
