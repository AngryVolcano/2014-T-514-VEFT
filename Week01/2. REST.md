# REST Services

[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REpresenational State Transfer) services were defined in a dissertation written by Roy Fielding in 2000.

The main characteristics of a REST service are:

* Client/Server
* Stateless - the server should not maintain client state. State is sent with each request.
* Cacheable - resources decide for themselves if they are cacheable or not (and how long)
* Hypertext driven (in an ideal world)

## REST Resources

A central concept in REST is the Resource. Each resource has a separate URI. For instance, the following are all
different resources:

* /api/v1/courses
* /api/v1/courses/26892
* /api/v1/courses/26892/students
* etc.

It is common to define a resource (such as /api/v1/courses) which represents a list (in this case, a list of courses). The URL /api/v1/courses/26892 represents a given instance of a course, and is a separate resource. Then, that particular course can have further subresources, such as a list of students (/api/v1/courses/26892/students).

## REST and HTTP

Technically, REST doesn't depend on HTTP. However, most REST services are implemented using HTTP, and the reason for
that is that HTTP fits wery well, since all the main characteristics of REST are also prevalent in HTTP.

It is therefore almost universal for REST services to use concepts from HTTP:

* Using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to indicate what kind of operation is being performed. The alternative is to put the verb into the URL, but this should be avoided.
* Using HTTP status codes (200 OK, 301 Redirect, 404 Not Found etc.) to indicate if the request was successful or not.
* Using the "Accept" HTTP Header to indicate what format should be used for data (XML, JSON etc.).
* Using cache-commands defined in HTTP to control caching.
* Using the "Location" HTTP header when a new entity is created, i.e. the response from the server should include the new Location.

[This answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1619152/how-to-create-rest-urls-without-verbs/1619677#1619677) from Stackoverflow has some really good guidelines when it comes to designing a REST service.

## REST Maturity Model

The REST Maturity Model was defined in 2008 by [Leonard Richardson](http://www.crummy.com/).

It has 4 levels:

* Level 0: A single URL, only accessible using HTTP POST
* Level 1: Resources
* Level 2: HTTP verbs
* Level 3: Hypermedia controls

Most REST services written today are at level 2 (or perhaps 2.5).

## HATEOAS

At level 3, a REST service will only define a single URL (a Root URL), which all subresources are accessible through.
