# Routing

ASP.NET MVC used to define routing in a separate file, i.e. routing is defined in a single file. A lot of MVC routing is
convention based, i.e. it is assumed that URLs correspond to _ControllerName/ActionName_.

This is still possible in Web API. However, in the latest version of Web API, 
[Attribute Routing](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/attribute-routing-in-web-api-2) 
has been added. This means we can define routing "inplace", i.e. we can specify what routing rules should apply for 
individual controllers and/or controller actions. Example:

```c#
[RoutePrefix("api/v1/my")]
public class MyController : ApiController
{
    [Route("grades")]
    public List<Grade> Grades()
    {
        ....
    }
    
    [Route("schedule")]
    public List<Event> Schedule()
    {
        ....
    }
}
```

In this case, there are two resources:

* /api/v1/my/grades
* /api/v1/my/schedule

The RoutePrefix attribute takes care of defining a common prefix for the routes, which are then defined explicitly for
each action which should be exposed as public APIs.

Note that in this case, the names of the functions match the name in the route, but this is not required.
