# Assignment 1

Note: you don't have to hand in this assignment.

In this first assignment, you should do the following:

* Install Visual Studio
* Create a simple Web API
* Install ASP.NET vNext
* Create the same API in vNext

## Install Visual Studio

Using Visual Studio 2013 is preferred, although 2012 should work as well. Ensure you install the latest update as well.

## Create a simple Web API

Go through the tutorial found [here](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/create-a-rest-api-with-attribute-routing) to create your first Web API project.

Test the API using [CURL](http://curl.haxx.se/), which you should install if it isn't already available on your machine.

## Install ASP.NET vNext

Go through the tutorial found at [https://github.com/aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) to install ASP.NET vNext.
Note that this project is still at early stages in development, and doesn't have feature parity with the current version
of ASP.NET Web API.

You might want to check out the kulture plugin for Sublime Text, which allows us to run commands directly from Sublime.
For instance, you can build the project, start a web server and open a browser from the command line. Check out
[this blogpost](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2014/08/12/develop-asp-net-vnext-applications-on-a-mac.aspx) as
