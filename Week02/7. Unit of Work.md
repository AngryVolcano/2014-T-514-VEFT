# Unit of Work

Our business logic will probably need to access a few database tables. However, we would also like to be able to easily
write unit tests for the business logic. One way to achieve this to use Unit of Work and the Repository pattern.

It must be stated that there are many different implementations of the Repository pattern available, and not everyone
agrees what it should really look like. There are also those which claim that it is not necessary at all.

The following articles explain the Repository pattern:

* [http://blog.longle.net/2013/05/11/genericizing-the-unit-of-work-pattern-repository-pattern-with-entity-framework-in-mvc/](http://blog.longle.net/2013/05/11/genericizing-the-unit-of-work-pattern-repository-pattern-with-entity-framework-in-mvc/)
* This one does actually explain it as well, although the title would indicate the author isn't fond of the pattern: [http://www.wekeroad.com/2014/03/04/repositories-and-unitofwork-are-not-a-good-idea/](http://www.wekeroad.com/2014/03/04/repositories-and-unitofwork-are-not-a-good-idea/)

In general, this is what it is all about:

* Create a generic IRepository interface, one table will map to exactly one repository.
* Create a IUnitOfWork interface, which is capable of returning a repository for a table, and takes care of committing changes to the database.
* Create concrete implementations of those interfaces

Our business logic will then look like this:

```c#
TODO
```
